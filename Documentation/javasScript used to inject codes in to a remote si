javasScript used to inject codes in to a remote site with help of cdn based delevery network

this explaination is based on the study of implementation methedology used and practiced by www.fanexam.com which is currently provideing NPS tool to its clients.

Defining the problem:"??how sould u embbed the NPS survey on a third party server whithout Access to its server side scripts ???"

to over come this problem we would use java script / client side scripts to full fill our goal of embeddeding the NPS survey on client site without touching /accesing their server side scripts.

a small scripts is embbeded on their site by them in side the <body>..</body> tag.
						
						$FE = {id:5496}; 
						$FE.email = ""; 
						$FE.tags = ""; // tags go in these quotes separated by commas 
						$FE.lang = "en-us"; // language + locale to be used 
						(function(d) { 
						    var ca = d.createElement("script"),t; 
						    ca.type = "text/javascript"; 
						    ca.async = true; 
						    ca.src = "//tag.fanexam.com/exam.js"; 
						    t = d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; //find all the script tag, go to the first script tag
						    t.parentNode.insertBefore(ca, t); //find its parrent and add the new tag before the first script tag
						})(document);  

the above tag has a object {**citation neeeded for $FE**} it holds the clients unique ID here 5496, rest are some additional variables . this script exewcutes a anonymous function to wich it sends current Document as a variable object.
this function creates a <script> tag dynamicaly attaches src to exam.js and appends at the  start of the <head> tag.

						//exam.js
							(function(d) {
								var fe = d.createElement("script"),t;
								fe.type = "text/javascript";
								fe.async = true;
								if ($FE.cache)
									fe.src = "//tag.fanexam.com/js/" + $FE.id + ".js?" + Math.random();
								else
									fe.src = "//tag.fanexam.com/js/" + $FE.id + ".js";//user customized js file , containing all settings , 
								t = d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; //design variables and all document variables.
								t.parentNode.insertBefore(fe, t);//attach a new script tag before the first one.
							})(document);
